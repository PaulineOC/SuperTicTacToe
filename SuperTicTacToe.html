		<div class="Rules">
			<h3>Rules:</h3>
			<p>Players take turns playing in the smaller tic-tac-toe boards until one of them wins in the larger tic-tac-toe board. </p>

			<p>
			Each small 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe board is referred to as a local board, and the larger 3-by-3 board is referred to as the global board. Each move sends the opponent to its relative location on the global board. If an X is played in the top right square of a local board, then the O must be played in the top right local board of the global board. 
			Here is <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe_forced_move.png" target="_blank">a visual example move</a>.
			</p>

			<div>
				
			</div>



			<p>If a move is played so that it is to win a local board by the rules of normal tic-tac-toe, then the entire local board is marked as a victory for the player in the global board. Moves that send players to this won board are still valid. </p>
			<p> Game play ends when either a player wins the global board, or there are no legal moves remaining.</p>
